During the course, we will use python 3.x and the packages numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, ipython and the ipython-notebook.


Linux
------

Use your favourite pachage manager to install: python3, python3-numpy, python3-scipy, python3-matplotlib, python3-seaborn, ipython3, ipython3-notebook
Now, check if ipython notebook works by typing:
ipython3 notebook
If it does, open a new notebook and type
import numpy
import scipy
import matplotlib.pylab
Press shift+enter and see what happens. If nothing happens and no error appears, everything is fine.
If the installation failed, if you don't have root privilege or if you prefer a local user installation, you can also try to install Anaconda as described below for Mac and Windows.



Windows and Mac
---------------

Download the python 3.X installer from
http://continuum.io/downloads 
and follow the instructions there. 

Anaconda also includes a graphical Launcher application that enables you to start IPython Notebook,
IPython QTConsole, and Spyder with a single click. 
On Mac, double click Launcher.app in your ~/anaconda directory. 
On Windows, youâ€™ll find Launcher in your Start Menu.

Start the IPython Notebook and type:
import numpy
import scipy
import matplotlib.pylab
Press shift+enter and see what happens. If nothing happens and no error appears, everything is fine.

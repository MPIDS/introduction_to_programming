### Motivation, what is python and why is it cool?
* 4 super cool things done w/ python
	* Frank : 
	* Norma : 
	* Henrik : 
	* Flo :
* what and why python? (Frank)
	* the ipython notebook
	* scientific programming w/ python: np, plt, sp
* what are we gonna do in the following days
	* presentations
	* exercises
	* project (3 backup projects)
		* Frank :  
		* Norma : image processing
		* Henrik : 
		* Flo : 

### Introduction to python syntax (27.10)

#### part 1

data types, data containers, loading data

#### part 2
loops, functions
.
.
.
#### part n

### Scientific programming w/python 

#### Part 1 (31.10)
1. basic linear algebra
2. scientific visualisation with matplotlib

#### Part 2 (14.11)
1. advanced numpy
2. scipy

### Extra topics

* pandas

* image processing (29.11)

* turtle

* code testing

* debugging

* oop

* git

* inter-phasing with C

* advanced python: decorators, context editors

* python and the open science movement (jupyter-notebook)


Ideas and things to keep in mind
--------------------------------

### Feedback

1. too fast
2. more examples on programming logic, algorithmic thinking: loops (for, while), functions, strings
3. plot/organise real recording data, especially since we had many patch-clamp lectures up to that point
4. less math and more biology in the exercise
5. divide class in beginners and advanced


### Proposals

* peer working, changing every lecture (1)
* learning through example (swc) (1, 2, 3, 4)
	* An introduction to Python for non-programmers using inflammation data.
* module 'turtle' for easy try and error experience
* showing some nice neuroscience applications in the beginning of the course (maybe some image processing of EM data or spike detection) (4)
* keep structure in the lectures: (1)
	* clear aim
	* short lectures
	* keep interaction with the students, through  questions and simple exercises
	* summary

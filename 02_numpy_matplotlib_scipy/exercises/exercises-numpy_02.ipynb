    "*** Data: ***\n",
    "\n",
    "The file ./data/produkt_klima_Tageswerte_19470101_20151231_01691.txt contains the daily measurements of the Göttingen weather station from 1947 untill 2015. It is just a plain text file, open it in a text editor to see how the data is organized.\n",
    "This dataset along with many others can be downloaded from the FTP-server of the DWD (German Meteorological Office):\n",
    "ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Preprocessing: ***\n",
    "* Load the data with np.loadtxt. Hint: The first line is the header and the last column contains text. Use the parameters of np.loadtxt to exclude these. \n",
    "* For convenience, you can extract some interesting columns with slicing, e.g. MESS_DATUM (date), LUFTTEMPERATUR (air temperature), REL_FEUCHTE (humidity), NIEDERSCHLAGSHOEHE (precipitation), SONNENSCHEINDAUER (duration of sunshine), and store them in a 1d-array.\n",
    "* Values of -999 indicate that there is no data available. This is annoying for many applications, e.g. if you compute the average or if you plot the data. Use a boolean index array to replace all -999 with the value np.nan (\"nan\" means not-a-number).\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Analysis: ***\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some ideas:\n",
    "* Plot some subsets of the data, e.g. the temperature of the last three years. Add some horizontal lines for the mean, min, and max values.\n",
    "* Plot a histogram and a cumulative distribution of the temperature data. Mark the positions of the median, the mean, the upper and lower 20%-percentiles, ...\n",
    "* Write a function which takes two arguments, a time series and a date, and returns the value of the time series on that specific day. \n",
    "* Challanging: Reshape the temperature time series into a two dimensional array such that its shape is 68 years x 365 days (before you do that you can use a boolean index array to remove the February 29th every four years). Then you can calculate the mean along one or the other axis to get a temperature profile of a year (averaged over all years) or the long-term trend of the temperature over 68 years, respectively. Both look even nicer if you do a moving average."
